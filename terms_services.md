#  Terms of Service

Welcome! Chaion (Shanghai) Information Technology Co., Ltd.. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides its services through mobile applications (collectively  “Makkii Wallet”).

Before using our Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or the “Agreement”) carefully, along with any other policies or notices on Makkii Wallet’s mobile applications, and our Privacy Policy located at http://45.118.132.89/privacy_policy.html. Together, these materials contain terms, rules, and guidelines related to your use of Makkii Wallet.

### OVERVIEW

We know that Terms can be long and confusing, so we will do our best to keep things as clear and concise as possible. This section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting all of the terms and conditions and not just this section.

- Makkii Wallet provides self-hosted wallet services for Aion blockchains.
- By creating or importing a wallet, downloading or running our mobile application, or visiting our website, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.
- These terms outline approved uses of Makkii Wallet, various licenses that we grant to you, and licenses that you grant us.
- If you have any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message on our website at <chris@aion.network>.
- If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use our Services.

### HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICY

By creating or importing a locally hosted wallet (a “Wallet”), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms, as well as the accompanying Privacy Policy located at http://45.118.132.89/privacy_policy.html.

We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. Any such changes with respect to your use of Makkii Wallet will take effect immediately when posted on our mobile application. Your continued use of Makkii Wallet following any such change will signify your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please check the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you have last reviewed these Terms. 

If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use Makkii Wallet. 
Failure or delay by Makkii Wallet in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.

### ELIGIBILITY

To be eligible to use Makkii Wallet, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old and be able to form legally binding contracts. 

If you are using our Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf. 

You can only use our Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you. 

By using Makkii Wallet, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use Makkii Wallet, however, and we reserve the right to change our eligibility criteria at any time.

### THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES

Makkii Wallet is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys that you may use to send and receive Aion; (b) allows users to browse third party decentralized applications (“DApps” or “DApp”) through the mobile application’s DApp browser.

**Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities.** An encrypted backup of certain information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in encrypted JSON format. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Aion Coin to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet address, mnemonic  phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet.

**Makkii Wallet Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval.** Makkii Wallet stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Aion Coin you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.

**Virtual Currency Transactions.** In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the Aion Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Makkii Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Aion Network.

**Makkii Wallet Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency.** We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Aion blockchain and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Makkii Wallet can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency. 

**Accuracy of Information Provided by User.** You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.

### WALLET REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION

You must either import or create a Wallet in order to use Makkii Wallet. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your mnemonic phrase, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security. 

We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet.  Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services’ backup functionality; (c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet.

**Payment and Fees.** Makkii Wallet does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a fee applies. 

**Transactions.** Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. Makkii Wallet has no control over any Aion blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Makkii Wallet account.

### THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT

In using our Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third parties and explore DApps by using Makkii Wallet’s DApp browser (the “Third Party Services”). We have no control over the content and policies of these Third Party Services (the “Third Party Content”) and, in no event, shall we be held responsible or liable for the accuracy, reliability, or currentness of any third party’s content or policies. Users who conduct transactions or take part in other activities through the Third Party Services do so at their own risk and we shall not be held responsible or liable for the Third Party Services’ compliance with state or federal laws and regulations. Users who access or use a Third Party Service through Makkii Wallet are also solely responsible for complying with the terms and policies of these third parties. 

In no event shall a description or reference to a third party’s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or promotion of such third party products or services by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third Party Service. 

If, to the extent permitted by Makkii Wallet, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Makkii Wallet account, either through the third party’s product or service or through Makkii Wallet, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your Makkii Wallet account.
